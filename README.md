+ **Project summary**: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the lives of New Yorkers and on NYC government agencies. This application focuses on how the pandemic has affected NYC311, the 311 service line that fields thousands of calls seeking information and assistance as well as filing complaints and reporting non-emergency violations. 311 acts as the first point of contact for any non-911 issues and redirects callers to the appropriate agency such as the Department of Buildings, NYPD, and etc. Using 311 call data found on [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), we observed changes in 311 call patterns that reflected the relevant COVID-19 issues and mandates at each stage of the pandemic. The results elicit insights that would be useful for the planning and mitigation efforts of NYC agencies. Understanding each borough's pertinent issues in response to COVID-19 and safety mandates would facilitate more effective future resource allocation and management by the departments directly handling incidents and cases.
